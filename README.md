# Presentations
Five or six years ago I did a pair of talks for cf.Objective() and a few other conferences on refactoring. The slides are admitedly ugly, but they contain good information and a rough outline of what I covered at each point in my talk. Both presentations were done for an audience that used ColdFusion.  

## Getting to Know Antipatterns
This presentation, first given in 2010, talks about design patterns gone wrong. Antipatterns are not only design patterns that were misused or poorly implemented, but also have a solution.
I gave an overview of general refactoring guidelines as well as examples of antipatterns that my team and I had run into ovet the past year.

## Making Legacy Code Testable
This one continued the theme of salvaging existing code bases rather than starting over. I covered why testing is important, then I talked about barriers to testing that happen in legacy code. Then I gave a few examples of how to fix it and introduce some unit testing.
